# COMP3311 21T3 Final Exam Q8
# Query execution times

(A)

The first exewcution tends to be slower than subsequent executions since the first query needs to start on a fresh database server. 

Once a query is executed the data gets stored within the cache thus faster execution times theron


(B)


The first query is most likey faster because finding the max id should be quicker since the data type would be an integer. 
The slower query has to compare date values which would take longer since it isnt simply an integer.
The max function for the date would have to compute the year, month and day thus taking three operations.
